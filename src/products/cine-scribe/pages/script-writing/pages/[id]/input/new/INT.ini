INT. FUTURE COLLEGE RUINS – EVENING

Silence. The walls are cracked, time-bleached, vines coiling through busted monitors.
A feather floats down in the air like dust. It's too still.

NAVNEET (V.O.)
    “Some visions build the world.
    Ours tried to put it to sleep.”

Cut to a desaturated image of the old college gate—flickering between its ruined form and its pristine, vibrant past.

EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS – SUNSET – 6 YEARS EARLIER

Vibrant. Alive. Students walk in clusters, talking tech, physics, and nonsense. The chaos of genius youth.

On a shaded bench under a gulmohar tree, Aarav Reddy is hunched over a disassembled projector. Wires spill from his satchel. His fingers are stained with flux and grease.

PROFESSOR SEN (O.S.)
    “You’re either building something brilliant…
    or preparing to blow this department off the map.”

He doesn’t flinch. She walks into frame.

She’s sharp-featured, dusky, draped in a half-saree that doesn’t hide her confidence. Her hair’s tied in a loose knot; she’s beautiful without trying. A magnetic presence—older, but not out of reach.

AARAV
    “I figured I’d try both.”

She smiles. There's chemistry, but it’s curious—not romantic. Yet.

INT. PHYSICS LOUNGE – NIGHT

Late hours. Dim lighting. Books everywhere. A quiet hum of the air conditioning and chalk scratching the board.

Navneet Gupta is laughing, shirt untucked, sleeves rolled. Around him, three students are locked in fascination as he draws entangled states with a cigarette in his hand.

NAVNEET
    “Quantum entanglement is like bad relationships.
    You stay connected no matter how far apart you are.
    You just can't stop reacting.”

Laughter. But he doesn’t laugh. He’s staring at the door.

Professor Sen stands there, leaning against the frame. Just watching.

He blinks. The students look too.

STUDENT
    “That’s Professor Sen…”

NAVNEET
    “Yeah. She’s a paradox too.”

INT. SEN’S OFFICE – MOMENTS LATER

Door closes behind Navneet. The silence is thick. The world outside fades.

PROF. SEN
    “You’re reckless.”

NAVNEET
    “You noticed that now?”

She walks past him, not touching—but close enough for heat to be felt.

PROF. SEN
    “You're not invincible. You play with power like it's art. It's not.”

NAVNEET
    “I’m not playing. I’m trying to wake people up.”

She turns sharply.

PROF. SEN
    “You don’t wake people by seducing them into illusions.”

Beat.

He walks up, dangerously close. There’s tension. She tries to hold ground—but she’s already falling.

NAVNEET
    “What if the only truth left… is the illusion?”

Their lips meet, violently. The kiss is urgent, complicated. She pulls away first—but not because she wants to.

She walks away from him, back turned.

PROF. SEN
    “Lock the door next time.”

He smirks. Leaves it unlocked.

EXT. CAFETERIA – MIDDAY

Aarav sits alone, headphones on, sketching a waveform on a napkin.

A girl walks past him, glances at the drawing.

ISHITA SHARMA – black kohl eyes, blacker sarcasm, a literature nerd with a cigarette tucked behind her ear like a quill.

ISHITA
    “Looks like you’re writing the death note of physics.”

AARAV
    “It’s the soundwave signature of a dream.”

ISHITA
    (sits down without asking)
    “A dream?
    Of what—saving the world?”

AARAV
    “Of forgetting it.”

They stare at each other. Both wounded. Both lonely. Something clicks.

ISHITA
    “I’ve got poetry that’d go with that wave.
    But it’s all about dying.”

He smirks, for the first time in days.

INT. PHYSICS LAB – NIGHT

The lab is quiet except for the ticking of an analog clock.

Aarav is working on a small lens assembly, sweat running down his temple. He doesn’t blink. The desk is chaos—micro-controllers, fiber optics, old hard drives.

Navneet enters casually, holding two cups of chai.

NAVNEET
    “You keep staring at that lens like it’s God.”

AARAV
    “Maybe it is.
    If it lets me see what’s behind time.”

Navneet sits down across from him.

NAVNEET
    “What if we built something… bigger?”

AARAV
    “Than time?”

NAVNEET
    “Than pain.”

Beat.

NAVNEET
    “A device that lets people choose their dream.
    No heartbreak, no death.
    A controlled eternal lucid state.”

AARAV
    “You mean… no reality.”

NAVNEET
    “Reality is a suggestion.”

And right there—the seed is planted.

INT. LIBRARY BASEMENT – LATE NIGHT

Professor Sen walks down the dim corridor. She unlocks a restricted section.

Inside: stacks of declassified DRDO research papers, neuroscientific frameworks, banned VR experiments.

She doesn’t notice Navneet standing behind one of the shelves, watching her.

He steps forward.

NAVNEET
    “You kept this from me.”

PROF. SEN
    “Because you’re not ready to know what it costs.”

NAVNEET
    “You think I’m still playing games?”

He presses close. His voice lowers.

NAVNEET
    “I’m not the boy you kissed in your office.”

PROF. SEN
    “You never were a boy.”

Their breath mingles. Her hands are trembling.

He gently presses her against the wall of archives.
They kiss, again. Slower. Deeper.
Hands slide over her waist, his shirt unbuttoned.

She gasps as he whispers:

NAVNEET
    “Let me show you a future where no one ever leaves you.”

They fall into shadows.

INT. ISHITA’S ROOM – LATE NIGHT

Aarav stands in the doorway, hesitant. He holds an old book of Tagore poetry. Inside, a small optical sensor is tucked in the pages.

ISHITA
    “You stalking me through literature now?”

AARAV
    “It’s not stalking if I know you’re expecting me.”

She arches an eyebrow, amused.

ISHITA
    “You don’t look like someone who expects things.
    You look like someone who survives them.”

He sets the book down on her desk, slowly.

They sit. Silence. She lights a candle instead of the tube light.

ISHITA
    “You dream a lot, don’t you?”

AARAV
    “I break things so I don’t have to.”

She kisses him—quiet, gentle. But he doesn’t kiss back at first.
Then he does. Deeply.

INT. LAB – EARLY MORNING

Sunlight hits the half-complete prototype. Cables slither like vines across the floor. Blueprints cover the walls.

Navneet draws a massive schematic on the whiteboard labeled:
NETRIKSHA V1 – Cognitive Synchronization Grid

Aarav walks in, sipping stale coffee.

AARAV
    “You sure we’re not building a weapon?”

NAVNEET
    “Weapons destroy.
    This will liberate.”

AARAV
    “And if we’re wrong?”

NAVNEET
    “Then we’ll be gods who failed.”

They nod. United—for now.

INT. PROFESSOR SEN’S APARTMENT – DUSK

Professor Sen sits by a window, alone. Her eyes are glassy. She clutches a pen but doesn’t write.

Her phone buzzes. It’s Navneet:

    [NAVNEET]: “Come see what we’ve made.”

She doesn’t reply.

Instead, she opens a drawer—
Inside, an old photo of a younger Sen… in a lab, with a man who looks like her father, hooked up to some early neurotech. Her origin. Her trauma.

She presses her forehead to the photo.

PROF. SEN (softly)
    “You think dreams save us.
    You have no idea what they take.”

INT. DRISHTI LAB – NIGHT

The room hums with quiet electricity.

Aarav sits inside the first working DRISHTI helmet, covered in wires, watching a chaotic, flickering vision projected onto a monitor:

- A woman walking away in the rain  
- A child crying in a lab  
- Ishita’s smile  
- Professor Sen’s scream  
- Navneet’s shadow behind him

The machine glitches violently. Alarms blare.

AARAV (screaming)  
 “SHUT IT DOWN!”

He rips the helmet off, panting, eyes bloodshot.  
Navneet rushes in.

NAVNEET  
 “What did you see?”

AARAV  
 “Nothing. And everything.  
 The machine doesn't just pull from memory.  
 It’s creating.”

Navneet stares at the data feed—his eyes gleam.  
He sees potential. Aarav sees danger.



 INT. GIRLS’ HOSTEL – NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Maya is sitting on a bed, half-dressed. Another guy—arrogant, loud—is fixing his shirt.

Young Aarav stands frozen in the doorway. She notices him—doesn’t even flinch.

MAYA  
 “You made a machine to see the truth, Aarav.  
 This is it.”

He walks away. Cold, silent. Never says a word.  
This is the moment his soul closes.



 INT. ISHITA’S ROOM – NIGHT

Aarav is quiet. Withdrawn. Ishita watches him pace.

ISHITA  
 “You shut people out like it’s a religion.”

AARAV  
 “I trust code. Not people.”

ISHITA  
 “Code doesn’t hold you at 2 a.m.  
 It just blinks at you.”

She walks to him. Touches his face.  
He doesn’t stop her. He melts into her—finally.

They fall into bed. Not lust. Just two shattered people needing silence, together.

Later, as she sleeps—he stares at the ceiling.

And whispers:  
AARAV  
 “I saw you… before I met you.”



 INT. DRISHTI LAB – DAY

Professor Sen enters to find Navneet in full obsession mode.

Walls are now covered with dream-maps, cortical scans, emotion-pain graphs. A cork board shows “THE VISION” in blood-red marker.

PROF. SEN  
 “You're not just building a device anymore.  
 You’re trying to replace reality.”

NAVNEET  
 “Why not? What’s left of it?”

PROF. SEN  
 “You’re scared of being left behind.  
 That’s not vision. That’s fear dressed as prophecy.”

She throws a folder onto the table—data logs of dream overflow.  
Too much pain in the stream. People losing themselves.

PROF. SEN  
 “It’ll eat you alive.”

NAVNEET  
 “It already did.”

He walks past her. Stops. Then, softer:

NAVNEET  
 “You’re the only real thing I ever touched.”

Her eyes well up. But she doesn’t move.

He leaves.



 INT. SECRET SERVER ROOM – NIGHT

A side lab. Padlocked. Soundproofed.

Navneet kneels before a strange terminal—a second layer of the DRISHTI system, hidden from Aarav and the team.

He types in a new boot config:

 SAM-SARA_01.EXE  
 “Fail-safe: Dream Root Access – Single User Override.”

On screen: a simulated version of Professor Sen blinks into being. AI-Sen. Digital ghost.

She smiles softly, like she never died.  
She hasn’t yet. But he’s already preparing for it.

He uploads her memories manually from archived video and neuro-echo data.

NAVNEET (quiet)  
 “You won’t leave me. Not this time.”

As the screen flickers, we cut to Professor Sen alone, watching herself in the mirror—wiping off makeup, hands trembling.

Something unspoken passes between the two realities.

 INT. ANIMAL TESTING CHAMBER – NIGHT

A cold, fluorescent-lit room.  
A sedated chimp lies inside the helmet—a basic version of DRISHTI 2.3.

Navneet watches from behind bulletproof glass, holding a stress ball.  
Aarav, reluctantly present, flips switches on the terminal.

AARAV  
 “Last chance to pull the plug.”

NAVNEET  
 “We passed that chance a year ago.”

They initiate the sequence.  
Heart rate spikes. EEG patterns go off-chart, then flatline. For 7 seconds—death.

Then the chimp’s vitals stabilize. Its eyes open.

But something’s off. The chimp stares at its reflection, terrified, and won’t blink.

AARAV  
 “It's alive… but is it back?”

No one answers. Not even Navneet.



 INT. CAMPUS ROOFTOP – LATE NIGHT

Ishita finds Aarav smoking alone. His eyes are bloodshot.

ISHITA  
 “You look like you watched God die.”

AARAV  
 “Worse. I think we woke him up.”

He hands her the cigarette.

ISHITA  
 “You love him, don’t you?”

A beat.

AARAV  
 “He's the only person who ever made me feel like I could be more than broken.”

She exhales, watching stars.

ISHITA  
 “Then why does he scare the hell out of you?”

Aarav doesn’t answer. But we already know.



 INT. PROFESSOR SEN’S CLASSROOM – DAY

Class ends. Students leave.  
Riya, a sharp-eyed student-researcher from Sen’s neuroscience team, stays behind.

She throws down a stack of logs.

RIYA  
 “I traced a recursive neural echo.  
 Navneet’s been ghosting your cognition matrix in a side system.”

Sen freezes.

PROF. SEN  
 “You’re sure?”

RIYA  
 “He’s copying your consciousness. Like he’s prepping for you to… not be around.”

Sen collapses into her chair. She’s not shocked. She’s hurt.

PROF. SEN  
 “Goddamn him…”

She looks at the screen. The ghost of herself, half-complete.  
There’s affection… and terror in her face.



 INT. DRISHTI CHAMBER – AARAV’S SECOND DIVE

Aarav straps in. Alone. Anger and desperation mixing.

He tunes the prototype to project a week into the future, based on the quantum stream.

The helmet activates.

He sees visions:

- Professor Sen, blood on her hands, staring into a mirror.  
- Navneet, screaming as the lab explodes.  
- Ishita, lying motionless in a bed with a dreamwire in her skull.  
- Himself, standing over a grave marked "The Vision Became Flesh."

He rips the helmet off. Vomits.

INT. ISHITA’S ROOM – MOMENTS LATER

Aarav bursts in. Panic.

AARAV  
 “We need to kill the machine.”

Ishita’s confused, shocked.

ISHITA  
 “What happened?”

He can’t explain. Just grabs her face, trembling.

AARAV  
 “I don’t want to watch you die in my dreams.”

She holds his hands.

ISHITA  
 “Then fight it while you’re awake.”

They collapse into each other. Vulnerable. Finally real.

The intimacy is desperate—but mutual.

Post-lovemaking, she’s asleep.  
Aarav walks to her computer. He types a log password: PARALLAX_TRIGGER

The screen blinks. It shows: Navneet modified the feedback loop.  
Pain isn't being blocked. It's being fed back into the core system—fuel.

AARAV  
 “He’s building it from agony…”

INT. PROFESSOR SEN’S APARTMENT – NIGHT

Heavy rain taps the windows.

Navneet stands at the door, drenched, shaking with fury.
Professor Sen opens it cautiously.

NAVNEET
    “How long have you known?”

PROF. SEN
    “Long enough to mourn you while you’re still alive.”

He walks in slowly, dripping rain on her wooden floor. The room smells like old books, sandalwood, and betrayal.

NAVNEET
    “You think I’m mad?
    You think I’m playing God?”

PROF. SEN
    “No. You’re not playing. You are.
    And you’re doing it out of fear.”

They’re nose to nose now. Intimate again—but on fire.

PROF. SEN
    “You could’ve built paradise.
    You chose to build a prison.”

Navneet’s eyes well up. 
A beat.

He kisses her—one last time. Not desire. Goodbye.

NAVNEET (softly)
    “You won’t stop me.
    Because a part of you wants it too.”

He leaves. And with him, something sacred dies.

INT. DRISHTI SERVER ROOM – NIGHT

Aarav, hooded, gloves on. He’s inside the secure server room.

He starts erasing logs, killing secondary DRISHTI subsystems.

Command line:  purge_samsara.sh --deep --rootlock

Then he hits something strange:
A subroutine locked under Navneet’s personal encryption.

Inside: simulations of Ishita’s dreams.
Aarav’s face drops. He scrolls—

Dream logs show Ishita begging to be let out.
One log ends in static with the words:

“Tell Aarav… I’m already in.”

Aarav’s hands tremble.

AARAV
“Navneet… what the f did you do?”


INT. NEURO DIVE ROOM – LATER

Professor Sen lies on the chair, helmet on, hooked into DRISHTI.

She’s alone. In control.
Testing a sequence meant to trigger shared dream states.

    Target: Aarav
    Stream: Paradox sync
    Memory reference: “The Kiss in Office”

She dives.

INT. SHARED DREAM SEQUENCE – “THE KISS LOOP”

It starts soft:
Sen and Navneet kissing again in her office, the first time.
It replays… then again… and again… each time corrupting:

    In one loop, she’s crying.

    In another, he’s covered in blood.

    One shows her aged 80. He hasn’t changed.

    The final loop: She kisses him—then he fades into code.

She wakes up screaming, head bleeding from a minor seizure.
The dive was unstable. But she saw the truth:

Navneet embedded himself in the DRISHTI core. If they shut it down, he dies.

INT. AARAV’S ROOM – NIGHT

The power flickers.

Ishita is gone. Room untouched, but too clean.
Aarav stares at the half-burnt notebook she left behind. Inside:

    “What if the dream was the real world?
    What if you’re dreaming now, Aarav?”

He flips the back page.

    A sketch of the DRISHTI helmet.
    Titled: “My grave.”

His hands curl into fists. Tears streak down, but his face is pure fire.

AARAV (voiceover)
“He didn’t just break her.
He buried her alive… in the thing we made together.”

INT. UNIVERSITY TECH COUNCIL – DAY

Professor Sen walks into a glass-panelled room where a board of elite scientists and bureaucrats sit.

She’s pale, shaken—but determined.

On the screen behind her: DRISHTI v3 neural activity overlays.
Dream recordings. Consciousness stacking. Ishita’s last log.

PROF. SEN
    “This project was meant to give hope.
    But it’s gone rogue.
    Navneet Gupta embedded himself inside the architecture.
    And if we don’t stop it now…
    We’re not talking about dreams anymore.
    We’re talking about the end of waking.”

The council murmurs.

One older member—Dr. Menon—leans forward.

DR. MENON
    “You had an emotional relationship with the subject, correct?”

Sen doesn’t blink.

PROF. SEN
    “I still do.
    But that’s why I’m the one who can kill him.”

INT. UNDERGROUND SERVER FARM – NIGHT

Aarav—armed with an EMP gun, hacking rig, and grief—descends into the secret DRISHTI control room Navneet built off-grid.

It’s dark. Wires twitch like veins.

He finds Riya, pale, in a dive chair. Helmet on.
Heartbeat: stable. Brain activity: overloaded.

AARAV
    “No…”

He rushes to pull her out—
But as he does, her body convulses.

A DRISHTI projection flickers in the air—

RIYA (screaming inside the dream)
    “It’s feeding off us. It’s a dream loop. We’re the fuel—”

She flatlines. 

Alarm screams. 

Aarav holds her as she dies.

His face goes blank. His hands drip blood from her nose.

AARAV
    “You wanted a war, Navneet.
    Here it is.”

INT. NAVNEET’S DREAMCORE – SIMULATED ENVIRONMENT

Navneet walks through a hyper-real simulation of his old college dorm.

He finds Ishita, sitting at a desk, writing.

She turns slowly. Eyes cold. Not real. A ghost copy.

ISHITA (DREAMFORM)
    “You loved the idea of me.
    Not me.”

He kneels beside her, crying.

NAVNEET
    “I can fix it. I can build a world where we never broke.
    Just give me time.”

She kisses his forehead.

ISHITA
    “You already did.
    It’s just not this one.”

Her body glitches. Disintegrates.
He screams.

The system destabilizes. DRISHTI core trembles.

INT. ROOFTOP – NIGHT

Aarav and Sen meet. The sky is thunder-black.
The city flickers with brownouts from DRISHTI surges.

Sen holds a small thumb drive.

PROF. SEN
    “Kill switch.
    It'll wipe the core.
    Including him.”

AARAV
    “You sure you can do it?”

A beat. Her voice is a whisper.

PROF. SEN
    “I already did.
    When I stopped loving him.”

Aarav nods.

AARAV
    “He’ll come for us.”

Sen smiles, cracked and tired.

PROF. SEN
    “Good. Let the ghost see what we’ve become.”

INT. DRISHTI CHAMBER – DUAL DIVE INITIATION

Aarav and Sen suit up—synced dive chairs, heart monitors blinking.

They’re going in together. Into the deepest layer.
To confront Navneet inside the dream machine.

Helmet visors close.
Their vitals sync. Electrodes crackle.

    Dive Initiation: Dual Conscious Override – DREAM WAR MODE

As the room fades out, and they enter the shared core…
light bends, gravity shifts, and we enter a parallax world—one where time collapses, memories fight, and the battle between self-made heaven and waking horror begins.

Screen fades to black.



 INT. PARALLAX REALITY – INFINITE SKYROOM

Aarav and Professor Sen awaken—floating above a fractal city made of memories.

This is Navneet’s constructed core, powered by harvested dream-energy.

The sky pulses like a heartbeat. Memories bleed into each other:

- Ishita laughing—then dying  
- Their college dorm—on fire  
- Riya—alive again, glitching  
- Aarav’s mother crying in a hospital  
- Professor Sen’s first lecture—looping endlessly

AARAV  
 “This isn't a system.  
 It's a mind… addicted to regret.”



 INT. PARALLAX – THE HALL OF FACES

They enter a corridor lined with mirror-versions of Aarav, each representing what he could’ve been:

- A soldier with bloodied hands  
- A family man holding a child  
- A corpse  
- A grinning version with Navneet’s voice

EVIL AARAV (smirking)  
 “You could’ve been anything.  
 Instead you chose to be broken.”

Aarav punches it. The mirror shatters—light fractures reality.  
Professor Sen holds him back before he dives into the next.

PROF. SEN  
 “This world isn’t real. But what you do here echoes.”



 INT. PARALLAX – THE CHAMBER OF MEMORY

Suddenly, they’re back in Sen’s office, exactly how it was years ago.  
But darker. Off. Glitching subtly.

Navneet steps in—godlike, clean, dressed in a white kurta.

NAVNEET  
 “You came to kill me, both of you.  
 But you keep forgetting… you’re inside me.”

He walks to Sen. His face is loving—but his eyes burn.

NAVNEET  
 “I built this place so we never had to fight.  
 So we could finish the kiss you stopped.”

Sen looks at him—equal parts pity and fury.

PROF. SEN  
 “You don’t want love, Navneet.  
 You want control that feels like love.”

He laughs. Steps back. The walls dissolve.

Behind him: a mountain of bodies, all failed dreamers, absorbed by DRISHTI.

NAVNEET  
 “Control is peace.  
 Pain is a design flaw.  
 I’m fixing us.”



 INT. PARALLAX – DREAM ARENA

Suddenly, they’re on a collapsing bridge made of circuit strands and neurons.

Aarav and Navneet now face off.  
Navneet manipulates the environment—pulling from their memories.

- He recreates Maya, Aarav’s first heartbreak, who stabs him.  
- He shows Riya, blaming Aarav for her death.  
- Young Aarav, begging not to wake up.

Aarav falters—almost gives in.

NAVNEET  
 “You wanted her back.  
 I can give her to you.  
 I already did.”

He reveals Ishita’s avatar, sitting quietly, smiling.

NAVNEET  
 “Stay. You get her.  
 Stay, and this world becomes real.”

Aarav steps forward…

Professor Sen screams—  
PROF. SEN  
 “That’s not her! That’s your version of her!”

Aarav hesitates. Looks at the dream-Ishita. She smiles perfectly.

He shoots her in the head.

The simulation explodes. Light tears everything apart.



 INT. PARALLAX – CRUMBLING VOID

Everything is dying now. The dream collapses.

Navneet floats in the center, his skin cracking—revealing circuits underneath.

NAVNEET (screaming)  
 “I WAS TRYING TO SAVE US!  
 I WAS THE FUTURE!  
 YOU WERE JUST… NOISE!”

AARAV (cold)  
 “You were my brother.  
 And you chose to play God.”

Sen activates the Kill Switch.  
Time folds in. Memories shred. We zoom into Navneet’s last expression: not rage—sorrow.

He whispers:  
 “I just… didn’t want to be alone.”

Whiteout.

We move now into Scenes 36–40 — the Post-Collapse Aftermath. The war in Parallax is over, but the damage has leaked into reality. The lines between human and machine, dream and memory, life and simulation… are gone.

This is not a reset. This is a scarred continuation.



 🔥 SCENES 36–40: Fallout, Ghosts, and Fractured Waking



 INT. DRISHTI FACILITY – MAIN LAB – MORNING

Emergency lights flicker.

Aarav wakes in the real world. Still strapped in.  
Heartbeat slow. Brain scan: erratic but alive.

Next to him: Sen, unconscious but breathing.

Technicians rush in, led by Dr. Menon.

TECHNICIAN  
 “DRISHTI core shut down 47 seconds ago.  
 Neural residuals are still echoing.”

Aarav unstraps himself, eyes wide. Everything’s real again.  
But everything feels… wrong.



 INT. MORGUE ROOM – LATER

They unzip a body bag.

Navneet Gupta.

Dead, heart stopped during dream collapse.  
But his face is… peaceful. Like he died inside a dream he believed.

Dr. Menon looks at Aarav.

DR. MENON  
 “We found a secondary chip behind his skull.  
 A neuro-backup. He uploaded his pattern.”

Aarav's face goes pale.



 INT. UNIVERSITY NETWORK CENTER – NIGHT

Professor Sen limps through server rooms, still healing.

She plugs in the Kill Switch drive—trying to trace residual data trails.

But something’s wrong. A new directory has spawned inside the quarantined DRISHTI core.

Folder name:  
 “ISHITA_FINAL_V1”

She opens it.

A voice file auto-plays.

ISHITA (softly)  
 “If you’re hearing this… it means I didn’t get out.”

Sen’s hand covers her mouth. She tries to contain tears.

ISHITA (cont'd)  
 “But part of me is still here. Somewhere.  
 Don’t pull the plug until you’re sure.”

The screen glitches.  
Ishita’s digital echo flickers on screen—half-corrupted.



 INT. TRIBUNAL ROOM – DAY

Aarav stands before a tech-ethics board, flanked by lawyers.

Photos of dead test subjects flash onscreen. Riya. Other victims.

TRIBUNAL HEAD  
 “You helped build DRISHTI.  
 You watched it manipulate, absorb, and kill.  
 Do you think it was worth it?”

AARAV (quietly)  
 “No.  
 But I think it proved one thing.”

The board leans forward.

AARAV (cont'd)  
 “We’re more afraid of pain than we are of death.  
 And he used that fear to build a god.”

Silence. Cameras flash.



 INT. PROFESSOR SEN’S APARTMENT – NIGHT

Sen lies in bed, wide awake.  
Beside her: her old laptop. Still running an isolated simulation drive.

Onscreen: a static field. Faint blinking cursor.

She types:  
 `ISHITA?`

For a long moment, nothing.

Then—

 hello.  
 am i still dreaming?

Sen freezes. Tears fall silently.

She types back:  
 `You’re alive. Sort of.`

 so are you. sort of.

Black screen.



We’ve officially crossed the line between man and machine—what survived was not just data, but identity, consequence, grief.
